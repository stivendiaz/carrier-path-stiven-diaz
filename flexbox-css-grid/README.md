# CSS GRID AND FLEXBOX

# 1. FLEXBOX

## Core concepts of Flexbox.

1. Flex Container and Flex Items:
   - The flex container is the parent element that holds the flex items.
   - To create a flex container, set the `display` property to `flex` or `inline-flex`.
   - Flex items are the child elements of the flex container.

Example:

```html
<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="flex-item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 3</div>
</div>
```

2. Flex Direction:
   - Defines the direction of the main axis along which flex items are laid out.
   - Use the `flex-direction` property to set the direction.
   - Common values are `row` (default), `row-reverse`, `column`, and `column-reverse`.

Example:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row-reverse;
}
```

3. Flex Wrapping:
   - Determines how flex items wrap or stay on a single line.
   - Use the `flex-wrap` property to control wrapping behavior.
   - Common values are `nowrap` (default), `wrap`, and `wrap-reverse`.

Example:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

4. Flex Items Alignment:
   - Flex items can be aligned along both the main axis and cross axis of the flex container.
   - Use `justify-content` to align items along the main axis and `align-items` to align items along the cross axis.
   - Common values for `justify-content` are `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, and `space-around`.
   - Common values for `align-items` are `stretch` (default), `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, and `baseline`.

Example:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: flex-start;
}
```

5. Flex Item Flexibility:
   - Flexibility determines how flex items grow or shrink to fill available space.
   - Use the `flex` property to control flex item flexibility.
   - The `flex` property accepts three values: `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.
   - `flex-grow` specifies the proportion of available space the item should take up.
   - `flex-shrink` defines how much the item can shrink if there is not enough space.
   - `flex-basis` sets the initial size of the flex item.

Example:

```css
.flex-item {
  flex: 1 0 200px;
}
```

## Flexbox Explained

The first grouping has to do with the flex-container, or the ul in this example.

1. `ul { display: flex; }` This gets everything on a single line. By default, the direction is in a row and in standard order.

2. `ul {display: flex; flex-direction: X; }` X = `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, `column-reverse` This takes the elements and places them in a single row or a single column. Ordering is either in source order or the reverse of the source order. Flex-direction defines our main axis.

3. `ul { display: flex; flex-direction: as before, flex-wrap: X;}` X = `wrap`, `wrap-reverse`, or `nowrap` `flex-direction` orders the individual items. `flex-wrap` orders the rows/columns created.

4. `ul { display: flex; flex-flow: X;}` `flex-flow` is shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` It takes two arguments, just like the individual properties. Example: row `wrap`, `row-reverse` `wrap`, `column nowrap`, `column-reverse` `wrap-reverse`, etc Just because the row/column is reversed does not mean the wrap has to be reversed

5. `ul { display: flex; flex-flow: row wrap; justify-content: X; }` X = `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly` `justify-content` determines the distribution of the flex items within the flex container on the main axis — in other words, how should space be allocated relative to the width of each item? If flex direction is row, then horizontal is the main axis. When flex-direction is column, then column is the main axis.

6. `ul { display: flex; flex-flow: row wrap; justify-content: center; align-items: X}` X = `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, baseline, stretch This aligns our items on the cross axis. Since we’re working with a row currently, this is aligning elements in vertical space.

7. `ul { display: flex; flex-flow: row wrap; justify-content: center; align-items: center; align-content: X}` \*X = `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly` Notice that changing align-content further aligns all boxes to the center of the ul. Without this, the boxes are distributed with space-around by default.

8. The next set of properties are about the individual flex-items, or the li’s in this example.

9. `.flex2{ border: 2px dotted blue; order: X; }` X can be an integer. 1 will move the .flex2 boxes to the end of the list, while -1 will move them to the start of the list. 0 is neutral.

10. `.flex2{ border: 2px dotted blue; flex-basis: X; }` flex-basis is analogous to width, but not quite the same thing. Width is an absolute measurement — an element is that wide, all the time. We can measure width in relative units (say 25% instead of 250px), but in the end, the measurement itself never changes. For flex-basis, we try to achieve a given width with the space available. It could be smaller than this width, or it could be wider, depending on the extra space and how that’s supposed to be distributed. Distribution of extra space is controlled by flex-grow and flex-shrink (below).

11. `.flex2{ border: 2px dotted blue; flex-grow: X; }` X can be 0 or a positive integer. (It won’t break with a negative integer, but it won’t do anything either.) flex-grow, like flex-shrink (below), distributes extra space once each element is displayed on the page. In this example, our flex items are center-aligned (see justify-content: center on the ul). By assigning a value to flex-grow, any extra space will be assigned in greater proportion to this element, making it larger relative to the other items. Note there is no unit with this measurement — it’s simply a proportion.

12. `.flex2{ border: 2px dotted blue; flex-shrink: X; }` X can be 0 or a positive integer. (It won’t break with a negative integer, but it won’t do anything either.) flex-shrink controls what happens to extra space as elements shrink. By assigning a value to flex-shrink, as elements get smaller on the page, this element will get smaller faster than the others. Note there is no unit with this measurement — it’s simply a proportion.

13. `.flex2{ border: 2px dotted blue; flex: G S B; }` G = `flex-grow` S = `flex-shrink` B = `flex-basis` This is the shorthand for combining `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.

## Advantages of using Flexbox over traditional layout methods

1. Simplified Markup:
   Flexbox allows you to achieve complex layouts with fewer elements and less nesting, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.

Example:

```html
<!-- Traditional Layout -->
<div class="container">
  <div class="left-column">
    <p>Left Content</p>
  </div>
  <div class="right-column">
    <p>Right Content</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Flexbox Layout -->
<div class="container">
  <div class="flex-item">
    <p>Left Content</p>
  </div>
  <div class="flex-item">
    <p>Right Content</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

2. Flexible and Dynamic Layouts:
   Flexbox provides flexibility in distributing space among flex items, adapting to different screen sizes and content lengths automatically.

Example:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

In the above example, the flex container evenly distributes space between the flex items, adjusting the layout dynamically as the screen size changes.

3. Easy Alignment and Distribution:
   With Flexbox, aligning items vertically or horizontally, distributing space, and controlling item order become straightforward tasks.

Example:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* Horizontally center items */
  align-items: center; /* Vertically center items */
}
```

In the above example, the flex container centers the flex items both horizontally and vertically.

4. Responsive Design:
   Flexbox simplifies the creation of responsive layouts, allowing for easy reordering and rearranging of items on different screen sizes.

Example:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.flex-item {
  flex: 1 0 100%;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .flex-item {
    flex-basis: 50%;
  }
}
```

In the above example, the flex items stack vertically on smaller screens (`flex-basis: 100%`), but on screens larger than 768 pixels, they span horizontally (`flex-basis: 50%`).

5. Alignment within Flex Items:
   Flexbox provides fine-grained control over aligning content within individual flex items, ensuring consistent alignment across different item sizes.

Example:

```css
.flex-item {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

## Fundamentals

1. Container and item terminology in Flexbox:

In Flexbox, the container refers to the parent element that holds the flex items. The items are the child elements inside the container.

Example:

```html
<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="flex-item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 3</div>
</div>
```

In the above example, the `<div>` with the class "flex-container" acts as the flex container, and the `<div>` elements with the class "flex-item" are the flex items.

2. Controlling the direction and flow of Flex items using flex-direction and flex-wrap:

The `flex-direction` property determines the direction of the main axis along which flex items are laid out. The `flex-wrap` property controls how flex items wrap or stay on a single line.

Example:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* or column, row-reverse, column-reverse */
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* or nowrap, wrap-reverse */
}
```

In the above example, the flex container is set to have a row direction (horizontal) using `flex-direction: row`, and the items will wrap onto multiple lines using `flex-wrap: wrap`.

Here's an expanded example to visualize the effects of `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`:

```html
<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="flex-item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 3</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 4</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 5</div>
</div>
```

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; /* or row, row-reverse, column-reverse */
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* or nowrap, wrap-reverse */
  height: 200px; /* Set a fixed height for visualization */
}

.flex-item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: coral;
  margin: 5px;
}
```

In the above example, the flex container is set to have a column direction (`flex-direction: column`) and wrapping enabled (`flex-wrap: wrap`). As a result, the flex items will flow in a column and wrap onto multiple lines when necessary.

## Flexbox Properties and Alignment

### Exploring the flex property and its variations (flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis

The `flex` property is a shorthand property that combines three individual properties: `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`. It allows you to control the flexibility and sizing of flex items within a flex container.

1. `flex-grow`:
   - The `flex-grow` property determines how much an item will grow relative to other flex items when there is extra space available.
   - By default, `flex-grow` is set to 0, meaning the item will not grow.
   - The value of `flex-grow` represents the proportion of available space the item should take up.
   - For example, if one item has `flex-grow: 1`, and another item has `flex-grow: 2`, the second item will grow twice as much as the first item.

Example:

```css
.flex-item {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

In the above example, all flex items with the class `.flex-item` have `flex-grow: 1`, indicating that they should grow proportionally if there is extra space available.

2. `flex-shrink`:
   - The `flex-shrink` property controls how much an item will shrink relative to other flex items when there is limited space.
   - By default, `flex-shrink` is set to 1, allowing the item to shrink proportionally.
   - The value of `flex-shrink` represents the proportion of shrinking ability compared to other flex items.
   - For example, if one item has `flex-shrink: 2`, and another item has `flex-shrink: 1`, the first item will shrink twice as much as the second item.

Example:

```css
.flex-item {
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

In the above example, all flex items with the class `.flex-item` have `flex-shrink: 0`, indicating that they should not shrink when there is limited space.

3. `flex-basis`:
   - The `flex-basis` property sets the initial size of an item before any remaining space is distributed.
   - By default, `flex-basis` is set to `auto`, which means the item's size is determined by its content or width/height properties.
   - You can use a specific length value (e.g., `flex-basis: 200px`) or a percentage (e.g., `flex-basis: 50%`) to define the initial size of the item.

Example:

```css
.flex-item {
  flex-basis: 50%;
}
```

In the above example, all flex items with the class `.flex-item` have `flex-basis: 50%`, indicating that their initial size should be 50% of the available space in the flex container.

Combined usage of the `flex` property:

```css
.flex-item {
  flex: 1 0 200px;
}
```

In the above example, all flex items with the class `.flex-item` have `flex: 1 0 200px`. This shorthand sets `flex-grow` to 1 (allowing the item to grow), `flex-shrink` to 0 (preventing the item from shrinking), and `flex-basis` to 200px (setting the initial size of the item).

### Aligning Flex items using justify-content and align-items

1. `justify-content`:
   - The `justify-content` property aligns flex items along the main axis of the flex container.
   - It controls how the available space is distributed between and around the flex items.
   - This property has various values such as `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, and `space-evenly`.
   - The default value is `flex-start`, which aligns items towards the start of the main axis.

Example:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

In the above example, the flex container with the class `.flex-container` is set to have `justify-content: center`, which horizontally aligns the flex items at the center of the container along the main axis.

2. `align-items`:
   - The `align-items` property aligns flex items along the cross axis of the flex container.
   - It controls how the items are positioned vertically within the container.
   - This property has various values such as `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`, and `stretch`.
   - The default value is `stretch`, which stretches the items to fill the cross axis.

Example:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
```

In the above example, the flex container with the class `.flex-container` is set to have `align-items: center`, which vertically aligns the flex items at the center of the container along the cross axis.

Combined usage of `justify-content` and `align-items`:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

In the above example, the flex container is set to have `justify-content: space-between`, which evenly distributes the flex items along the main axis, and `align-items: center`, which vertically aligns the items at the center of the container along the cross axis.

### Understanding cross-axis alignment with align-content and align-self

1. `align-content`:
   - The `align-content` property aligns the flex lines within the flex container along the cross axis.
   - It is applicable when there are multiple lines of flex items in a flex container, and it controls the spacing and distribution of those lines.
   - This property has various values such as `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, and `stretch`.
   - The default value is `stretch`, which stretches the flex lines to fill the cross axis.

Example:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  align-content: center;
}
```

In the above example, the flex container with the class `.flex-container` is set to have `align-content: center`, which vertically aligns the flex lines at the center of the container along the cross axis.

2. `align-self`:
   - The `align-self` property aligns an individual flex item along the cross axis, overriding the alignment set by `align-items` on the flex container.
   - It allows you to target specific flex items and control their alignment independently.
   - This property has various values such as `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`, and `stretch`.
   - The default value is `auto`, which inherits the value from `align-items` on the flex container.

Example:

```css
.flex-item {
  align-self: flex-end;
}
```

In the above example, the flex item with the class `.flex-item` is set to have `align-self: flex-end`, which aligns it at the end of the cross axis within the flex container, regardless of the `align-items` value set on the container.

Combined usage of `align-content` and `align-self`:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: space-around;
}

.flex-item {
  align-self: center;
}
```

In the above example, the flex container is set to have `align-content: space-around`, which creates equal spacing between the flex lines along the cross axis. The flex item with the class `.flex-item` has `align-self: center`, which centers it within its individual flex line.

## Creating Flexible Layouts

### Creating responsive layouts with Flexbox

1. Using `flex-direction` for responsive row/column layouts:
   - The `flex-direction` property controls the direction of flex items within a flex container.
   - By changing the `flex-direction` value, you can create different layouts for different screen sizes.
   - Setting it to `row` creates a horizontal layout, while `column` creates a vertical layout.

Example:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* or column */
}
```

In the above example, the flex container with the class `.flex-container` has `flex-direction: row`, creating a horizontal layout. You can change it to `flex-direction: column` to create a vertical layout.

2. Using `flex-wrap` to control wrapping:
   - The `flex-wrap` property controls whether flex items should wrap to the next line when there is not enough space in the flex container.
   - It allows you to create responsive layouts that automatically adjust and wrap items as needed.

Example:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

In the above example, the flex container with the class `.flex-container` has `flex-wrap: wrap`, allowing flex items to wrap to the next line when necessary.

3. Using `media queries` for responsive breakpoints:
   - Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the screen size or device characteristics.
   - By combining Flexbox properties with media queries, you can create responsive layouts that adapt to various breakpoints.

Example:

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .flex-container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

In the above example, the flex container has a default `flex-direction: row` for screens wider than 768px. However, when the screen size becomes 768px or narrower, the `flex-direction` is overridden with `flex-direction: column`, creating a vertical layout.

# 2. CSS GRID

## Getting Started with CSS Grid

CSS Grid is a cutting-edge layout system that provides a two-dimensional grid structure for organizing and positioning elements on a web page. It offers a more intuitive and flexible approach to layout design compared to traditional methods like floats or positioning. With CSS Grid, you have precise control over both rows and columns, enabling you to create complex, grid-based designs effortlessly.

1. Simplifying Layout Structures:

   - CSS Grid simplifies the process of creating complex layouts by allowing you to define both the rows and columns of your grid explicitly.
   - You can set up your grid with desired column and row sizes, or let CSS Grid automatically handle the sizing for you.

2. Grid-based Designs:

   - CSS Grid enables you to build grid-based designs that resemble magazine layouts or card-based interfaces with ease.
   - By dividing your page into a grid, you can position and align elements precisely within the grid cells, creating visually appealing and organized layouts.

3. Responsive Layouts:

   - CSS Grid provides robust support for responsive layouts, allowing your designs to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
   - With media queries and grid properties, you can modify the grid structure at various breakpoints, reordering and resizing grid cells to ensure optimal display across devices.

4. Flexibility and Control:

   - CSS Grid gives you unparalleled control over the placement and alignment of elements within the grid.
   - You can specify the size of individual grid cells, create flexible grid tracks, and even overlap elements if desired.

5. Browser Support:
   - CSS Grid enjoys widespread support in modern browsers, making it a reliable choice for building layouts.
   - It is essential to understand the level of support in different browsers and consider fallback options for older or less compatible browsers.

## Exploring the Grid Container and Grid Items in CSS Grid

The grid container is the parent element that establishes the grid context for its child elements. It is where we define the overall grid structure and properties.

1. Setting up a Grid Container:

   - To create a grid container, we apply the `display: grid` property to the container element.

   Example:

   ```css
   .grid-container {
     display: grid;
   }
   ```

2. Defining Grid Tracks:

   - Grid tracks are the horizontal and vertical divisions of the grid.
   - We can define the size and number of tracks using properties like `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns`.

   Example:

   ```css
   .grid-container {
     display: grid;
     grid-template-rows: 100px 200px;
     grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
   }
   ```

   In the above example, the grid container has two rows with heights of 100 pixels and 200 pixels, and two columns with a ratio of 1:2.

### Grid Items

Grid items are the child elements of the grid container. They occupy the individual cells within the grid and can be positioned and aligned as per our requirements.

1. Placing Grid Items:

   - By default, grid items are automatically positioned within the grid in the order they appear in the HTML markup.
   - We can manually control the placement of grid items using properties like `grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end`, `grid-row-start`, and `grid-row-end`.

   Example:

   ```css
   .grid-item {
     grid-column-start: 2;
     grid-column-end: 4;
     grid-row-start: 1;
     grid-row-end: 3;
   }
   ```

   In the above example, the `.grid-item` is placed starting from the second column and spanning until the fourth column, and from the first row to the third row.

2. Auto Placement of Grid Items:

   - CSS Grid also supports automatic placement of grid items using the `grid-auto-flow` property.
   - By setting it to `row` or `column`, the items will be automatically placed in the next available cell, creating a flow-like structure.

   Example:

   ```css
   .grid-container {
     display: grid;
     grid-auto-flow: column;
   }
   ```

   In the above example, the grid items will be placed in a column-wise order, automatically filling the available cells.

## Understanding the difference between rows and columns in CSS Grid.

In CSS Grid, both rows and columns play a crucial role in creating a grid-based layout. Here's the difference between rows and columns in CSS Grid:

Rows:

- Rows in CSS Grid define the horizontal tracks within the grid.
- They determine the height and placement of grid items vertically.
- Row tracks can be explicitly defined using properties like `grid-template-rows`, where you specify the height of each row individually, or using `grid-auto-rows`, where the rows are automatically sized based on their content.
- Rows can also be set to automatically adjust their height based on the content using the `auto` keyword.

Example:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px; /* Defines two rows with heights of 100 pixels and 200 pixels */
}
```

Columns:

- Columns in CSS Grid define the vertical tracks within the grid.
- They determine the width and placement of grid items horizontally.
- Column tracks can be explicitly defined using properties like `grid-template-columns`, where you specify the width of each column individually, or using `grid-auto-columns`, where the columns are automatically sized based on their content.
- Columns can also be set to automatically adjust their width based on the content using the `auto` keyword.

Example:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr; /* Defines two columns with a ratio of 1:2 */
}
```

## Creating a Grid Container

1. Setting up a grid container using the `display: grid` property:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
}
```

2. Exploring the various properties for defining the grid layout, such as `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, and `grid-gap`:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr; /* Defines two columns with a ratio of 1:2 */
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px; /* Defines two rows with heights of 100 pixels and 200 pixels */
  grid-gap: 10px; /* Adds a gap of 10 pixels between grid cells */
}
```

3. Demonstrating how to create a basic grid structure with fixed column and row sizes:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 200px; /* Defines two columns with fixed sizes of 100 pixels and 200 pixels */
  grid-template-rows: 50px 100px; /* Defines two rows with fixed sizes of 50 pixels and 100 pixels */
}
```

In the above examples, the `.grid-container` represents the container element that will be transformed into a grid container using the `display: grid` property. The subsequent properties like `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, and `grid-gap` allow you to define the grid's structure, column and row sizes, and the spacing between grid cells.

## Grid Item Placement and Alignment

### Placing Grid Items

1. Using the `grid-column` and `grid-row` properties to place grid items within the grid container:

```css
.grid-item {
  grid-column: 2 / 4; /* Specifies the grid item should span from the 2nd column line to the 4th column line */
  grid-row: 1 / 3; /* Specifies the grid item should span from the 1st row line to the 3rd row line */
}
```

2. Understanding grid lines and grid areas for precise item placement:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 200px;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 100px;
}

.grid-item {
  grid-column-start: 1; /* Specifies the grid item should start at the 1st column line */
  grid-column-end: 3; /* Specifies the grid item should end at the 3rd column line */
  grid-row-start: 1; /* Specifies the grid item should start at the 1st row line */
  grid-row-end: 2; /* Specifies the grid item should end at the 2nd row line */
}
```

3. Exploring shorthand notations for grid item placement:

```css
.grid-item {
  grid-area: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4; /* Specifies the grid item should span from row line 1 to row line 3, and from column line 2 to column line 4 */
}
```

In the above examples, the `.grid-item` represents individual elements within the grid container. The properties like `grid-column` and `grid-row` or their individual counterparts (`grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end`, `grid-row-start`, `grid-row-end`) are used to specify the placement of grid items by referencing the grid lines (vertical and horizontal lines that form the grid).

The shorthand notation `grid-area` allows you to specify both the row and column positions in a single property, simplifying the code.

### Aligning Grid Items:

1. Using alignment properties like `justify-items` and `align-items` to control the placement of grid items within their respective cells:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  justify-items: center; /* Aligns grid items horizontally at the center of their cells */
  align-items: center; /* Aligns grid items vertically at the center of their cells */
}
```

2. Demonstrating how to align items horizontally and vertically using `justify-content` and `align-content`:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 100px);
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 100px);
  justify-content: space-around; /* Distributes grid items evenly along the horizontal axis */
  align-content: space-between; /* Distributes grid items evenly along the vertical axis */
}
```

3. Explaining the difference between aligning content inside grid items versus aligning grid items within the container:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  justify-items: center; /* Aligns content inside grid items horizontally at the center */
  align-items: center; /* Aligns content inside grid items vertically at the center */
}

.grid-item {
  justify-self: end; /* Aligns the grid item itself horizontally to the end of its cell */
  align-self: start; /* Aligns the grid item itself vertically to the start of its cell */
}
```

In the above examples, the `.grid-container` represents the grid container, and the `.grid-item` represents the individual elements within the grid.

By using properties like `justify-items` and `align-items`, you can control the alignment of grid items within their respective cells. The values can be set to `start`, `center`, `end`, `stretch`, or `baseline`.

The `justify-content` and `align-content` properties allow you to align the entire grid of items within the grid container. The available values are `start`, `center`, `end`, `stretch`, `space-around`, `space-between`, and `space-evenly`.

Lastly, the `justify-self` and `align-self` properties are used to align the grid items themselves within their respective cells, overriding the alignment set by the container.

## Creating Responsive Grid Layouts

### Responsive Grid with Media Queries:

1. Utilizing media queries to create responsive grid layouts for different screen sizes:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; /* Default: 2 columns */
  grid-gap: 10px;
}

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* 1 column for screens smaller than 600px */
  }
}
```

2. Adapting the number of columns and row sizes based on breakpoints:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* Default: 3 columns */
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 200px); /* Default: 2 rows */
  grid-gap: 10px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(
      2,
      1fr
    ); /* 2 columns for screens smaller than 768px */
    grid-template-rows: repeat(
      3,
      150px
    ); /* 3 rows for screens smaller than 768px */
  }
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* 1 column for screens smaller than 480px */
    grid-template-rows: repeat(
      4,
      100px
    ); /* 4 rows for screens smaller than 480px */
  }
}
```

3. Exploring the `minmax()` function and `auto-fill`/`auto-fit` for flexible and responsive grid layouts:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(
    auto-fill,
    minmax(200px, 1fr)
  ); /* Flexible columns with minimum width of 200px */
  grid-gap: 10px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(
      auto-fill,
      minmax(150px, 1fr)
    ); /* Flexible columns with minimum width of 150px */
  }
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .grid-container {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(
      auto-fit,
      minmax(100px, 1fr)
    ); /* Flexible columns with minimum width of 100px */
  }
}
```

In the above examples, media queries are used to define different grid layouts based on specific screen sizes. The grid container is adjusted using `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, and other properties to adapt to the desired layout for each breakpoint.

### Grid Auto Placement

1. Understanding the automatic placement of grid items using the `grid-auto-flow` property:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-auto-flow: row; /* Default: items placed in rows */
}
```

2. Exploring the difference between dense and sparse packing algorithms:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-auto-flow: dense; /* Enables dense packing algorithm for auto-placed items */
}
```

3. Utilizing grid templates for defining explicit placement rules:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: 100px;
}

.grid-item {
  grid-column: 2 / 3; /* Explicitly places the item in the second column */
  grid-row: 1 / span 2; /* Explicitly places the item in the first row and spans two rows */
}
```

In the above examples:

- The `grid-auto-flow` property is used to control the automatic placement of grid items. The default value is `row`, which places items in rows. You can also use `column` to place items in columns.

- By setting `grid-auto-flow` to `dense`, the grid container will use a dense packing algorithm, which fills in any empty spaces between items.

- The grid templates in the third example (`grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`) define the explicit layout of the grid. The `grid-column` and `grid-row` properties on individual items are then used to explicitly place them within the defined grid template.
